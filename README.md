# Baseline_PLS2_Model

# Introduction
This repository contains code and experimental data for a baseline PLS2-based imputation algorithm.

The directory, Original_data, contains the original NMR spectroscopy and ultracentrifugation (UC) measurements of the LipoProtein (LP) fractions and subfraction in human blood. 
The NMR spectra are from 1.4 to 0.6 p.p.m. range. The spectra originally contained 316 uniformly distributed samples and the spectral length is 3488. The UC dataset contains some values with no reliable references and therefore should be considered as missing values (MVs). The MVs are replaced with zero value in the current dataset. 

The codes will be added to the main directory asap.
